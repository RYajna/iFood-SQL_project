# iFood Data Analysis Project

## About
This project aims to explore the iFood sales data in order to find valuable insights so as to improve and optimize sales strategies.
The dataset can be found on [Github](https://github.com/nailson/ifood-data-business-analyst-test/tree/master).

"Consider a well-established company operating in the retail food sector. Presently they have
around several hundred thousands of registered customers and serve almost one million
consumers a year. They sell products from 5 major categories: wines, rare meat products, exotic
fruits, specially prepared fish and sweet products. These can further be divided into gold and
regular products. The customers can order and acquire products through 3 sales channels: physical
stores, catalogs and companyâ€™s website. Globally, the company had solid revenues and a healthy
bottom line in the past 3 years, but the profit growth perspectives for the next 3 years are not
promising... For this reason, several strategic initiatives are being considered to invert this
situation. One is to improve the performance of marketing activities, with a special focus on
marketing campaigns."

## Purpose of the project
The main aim of this project is to understand the data, find business opportunities & insights and to propose
any data driven action to optimize the campaigns results & generate value to the company.

### Issues spotted:
1. No Primary Key --> Added Customer_ID column
2. Several column headings were not meaningful --> Changed Column headings
3. Some columns added no value to the dataset (e.g Z_CostContact only contained value 3) --> columns dropped
4. Wrong type for columns containing spendings (Wine_Spending, Fruits_Spending,...) --> Changed type to currency
5. Column Regular_Prod_Spending had 3 negative values (Perhaps customers were refunded)
6. A quick auto sum on excel of all the spending columns (Wine + Fruits + Meat + Fish + Sweets +Gold + Regular Products) revealed that the Spending is not equal to Total_Spending:

- Verification:

   I summed all the spendings in a column
   
   I then divided the spendings with Total_Spending to find that it was indeed twice the amount.

- Another interesting observation:
   
  Wine + Fruits + Meat + Fish + Sweets = Total_Spending
  
  Gold + Regular Products = Total_Spending
